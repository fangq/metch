     Metch - a mesh/volume registration toolbox

----------------------------------------------------------

Metch ChangeLog:

2008/12/17 (v0.5.0, alpha release, codename: Marshmallow)
	1. after extensive debugging, metchgui is now able to 
           perform all critical functionalities of the toolbox; 
           it supports return values and result export/import;
           we also provided a stand-alone m-file of the GUI
        2. added documentation and demonstration scripts
        3. affinemap now calc. least-square solutions, therefore, it
           accepts point pairs more than or less than 4.
        4. tested in Octave with demos

2008/12/05 (v0.2)
        1. wrote a Guass-Newton based optimization script to optimize
           affine transformation matrix (A/b) to get better 
           point-to-surface fitting.
        2. wrote a point-to-surface projection subroutine to get
           make sure the resulting points locating exactly on the 
           surface
        3. profiled the subroutines and extensively optimized the 
           computational efficiency

2008/11/07 (v0.1)
        1. extracted a set registration functions from a workflow
           developed for an on-going research project for 
           brain-functional imaging
